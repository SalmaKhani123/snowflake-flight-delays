# Cleaning Log — 2025-09-12

**Worksheet:** Flight_Project_Main  
**Goal:** Define simple, defensible cleaning rules for flight delays.

**Rules chosen**
- Negative delays → 0
- Delays > 1000 min → NULL
- CANCELLED normalized (0/1 → TRUE/FALSE)
- Uppercase OP_CARRIER/ORIGIN/DEST
- DISTANCE 0 → NULL

**Status**
- Using raw table `flight_project.flight_project_raw.flights` for KPIs right now.
- `flights_clean` will be (re)built later; keeping analysis unblocked.

**Sanity checks (run later, optional)**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS rows_raw,

  MIN(ARR_DELAY) AS arr_min, MAX(ARR_DELAY) AS arr_max,
  SUM(IFF(CANCELLED = 1, 1, 0)) AS cancelled_true,
  SUM(IFF(CANCELLED = 0, 1, 0)) AS cancelled_false
